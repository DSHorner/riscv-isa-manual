\item A optional mechanism to change the base ISA used by supervisor and user
      modes has bee added.
\item A mechanism to improve virtualization performance by
      trapping S-mode virtual-memory management operations has been added.
\item The supervisor virtual memory configuration has been moved from the
      {\tt mstatus} register to the {\tt sptbr} register.
\item The SFENCE.VM instruction has been removed in favor of the improved
      SFENCE.VMA instruction.
\item Hardware management of page table entry Accessed and Dirty bits has
      been made optional; simpler implementations may trap to software to
      set them.
\item The counter-enable scheme has changed, so that H-mode and S-mode can
      control availability of counters to S-mode and U-mode, respectively.
\item The interrupt-enable stack discipline has been simplified.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Preface to Version 1.9.1}

This is version 1.9.1 of the RISC-V privileged architecture
proposal.  Changes from version 1.9 include:

\begin{itemize}
  \parskip 0pt
  \itemsep 1pt
\item Numerous additions and improvements to the commentary sections.
\item Change configuration string proposal to be use a search process
  that supports various formats including Device Tree String and
  flattened Device Tree.
\item Made {\tt misa} optionally writable to support modifying base
  and supported ISA extensions.  CSR address of {\tt misa} changed.
\item Added description of debug mode and debug CSRs.
\item Added a hardware performance monitoring scheme.  Simplified the
  handling of existing hardware counters, removing privileged versions
  of the counters and the corresponding delta registers.
\item Fixed description of SPIE in presence of user-level interrupts.
\end{itemize}
